# Live model discovery

Deploy with `kubectl apply -k deploy/platform/model-aggregator`. Kustomize bundles
`aggregator.py` into a versioned ConfigMap and rolls the deployment on changes.

Every 28 seconds the aggregator lists Services in its own namespace and queries
`/v1/models` on llm-d decode services, Dynamo frontends, and any other serving
Service labeled `token-labs/model=true`. Services need an `http` port or port
8000. Model IDs come exclusively from successful backend responses. Unavailable
or removed backends disappear on the next refresh; duplicate model IDs merge.
A failed Kubernetes discovery returns 503, never a static or stale fallback.

The route-specific EnvoyExtensionPolicy lets the two exact model-list paths
reach this aggregator instead of the AI processor's configured model inventory.
Inference routes and SecurityPolicies are unchanged.

Run tests with `python -m unittest discover -s deploy/platform/model-aggregator`
in an environment with FastAPI and httpx installed.
